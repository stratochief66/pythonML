# pythonDemo1

Takes 2D data, plots it and fits it using Python libraries. A very simple "Hello World!" level re-implementation of the first assignment.

# pythonDemo2

CSV data is brought in which contains two features and one category: x data (student's grades on 2 separate tests) and y data representing whether they were admitted to university or not.

Logistic regression is performed on these 2 features, resulting in a linear best fit boundary estimation between the regions of accepted and rejected potential students.

Below is a 2D rendering of the source data. When the code is actually executed, a 3D plot is generated.
